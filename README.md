Words
=====

The word list behind [Letterpress](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/). Loosely based on a collection of other word lists with refinements from real-world feedback. I hope this is useful for other word-based-app makers, and as a way to improve Letterpress.

Contributions
=============

Contributions are welcome! A few guidelines:

- Keep diffs short. One word at a time is probably best.
- When proposing an addition, links to definitions in established dictionaries are good.
- Same rules as Letterpress (and other similar games), no proper nouns, acronyms, etc. (The list does have a few acronyms and abbreviations, but those may remain for historical reasons, as they've been allowed in other popular word games).
- Limit esoteric and domain-specific words.

Structure
=========

Each language should be in a file Words/*[ISO 639-1]*.txt. All words should be lowercase and the file kept sorted.
